# This file should contain all the record creation needed to seed the database with its default values.
# The data can then be loaded with the rails db:seed command (or created alongside the database with db:setup).
#
# Examples:
#
#   movies = Movie.create([{ name: 'Star Wars' }, { name: 'Lord of the Rings' }])
#   Character.create(name: 'Luke', movie: movies.first)
Sale.destroy_all

# Sale.create(customer_name: "Marcus", item_description: "laptop", item_price: 3.00, quantity: 1, merchant_name: "megaphone", merchant_address: "134 lane")
